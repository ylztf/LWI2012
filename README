Building This Project

1. Begin by installing boost. You may be able to use your system's provided
boost package, or you may need to begin by downloading boost from 
http://www.boost.org/users/history/. The only supported version is Boost 1.46.1.

2. If you are using a boost package skip to 4.

If you aren't using a package of boost, build it by extracting the source
tarball you downloaded to your home directory, navigating to it and successivelyinvoking `bootstrap.sh` and then `bjam` which, assuming you have all the right
packages installed, will build boost.

3. Next, define the BOOST_ROOT environment variable in your `.bashrc` by setting
it to the directory you build boost in. For example
`export BOOST_ROOT='~/boost/'` should be added to your `.bashrc`.

4. Navigate to the `Broker` directory within the source you cloned from github
and invoke `cmake.` This will prepare all the makefiles.

5. Lastly, call make and wait for the FREEDM project to build.
